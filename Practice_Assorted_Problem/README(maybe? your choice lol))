So, in all honestly none of these were insanely hard, most of them had an error or two and boom fixed or heck none at all, 
usually done in a few minutes.
For number 2 and 11 however, I knew there a simpler or more "normal" way to solve them but I REALLY wanted to try out my idea and make it work.
As you can see though, those two were a failure, although I'm pretty sure some of my codes are still different from the average in class,
it stressed the hell out of me for not being able to make it work, even if it wasn't more efficient I just wanted it to work somehow lmao,
but well, I failed so rip.
Anyway, just wanna say sorry for wasting your time and taking so long just to submit this exercise, and mostly sorry for not following
your or anyone's code directly. Personally I find it much more fun to try and figure out your own way of doing things and copying simply isn't
satisfying at all. Always have been this way since middleschool by the way. xD But yea, if I seem like I'm not listening in class its either
I'm familiar with the topic already (which sounds arrogant but uh... you get it >.>) or I just had an idea of my own to solve it and really
wanted to try it.
Again sorry for the trouble. xD

(P.S. I spent like 4 hours scrounging up info online to fix my code for answers like Num 2 and 11 and took only a few mins after I gave up 
and just decided to do it the "normal" way. xD)

(P.S.S. Not even sure why I wrote this....)

(P.S.S.S. Experimentation ftw but omg is it draining if it doesn't work. xD)

(P.S.S.S.S. If you're reading this before looking at the code, I left some comments on Num_2 and Num_11.)

(P.S.S.S.S.S. Yes I stayed in class until this time to finish it lol. By the way sir, if you can send me a few challenges, those would be 
welcome.)
